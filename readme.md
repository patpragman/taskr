# Taskr

**Taskr** is a lightweight command-line tool written in Go for quickly storing, listing, and removing timestamped notes. It uses a simple `.csv` file as the backend and a TOML-based config file to control where notes are stored.

---

## üß† Features

- Add timestamped notes with a single command
- List all existing notes with index
- Remove notes by index
- Count the number of notes
- Configurable file location via TOML
- Human-readable CSV backend
- Clean shell integration with dynamic prompt

---

## üõ† Installation

### 1. Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/patpragman/taskr.git
cd taskr
go build -o taskr
```

### 2. Set up your config file

Create a `config.toml` file at:

```bash
~/.local/etc/taskr/config.toml
```

Example:

```toml
Version = "1.0.0"
LocalStorage = true
StorageAddress = "/home/yourusername/.local/share/taskr/notes.csv"
```

Create the storage directory if it doesn‚Äôt exist:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/taskr
touch ~/.local/share/taskr/notes.csv
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Taskr requires a valid config file at `~/.local/etc/taskr/config.toml`. It will not function without it.

## üñ•Ô∏è Shell Prompt Integration

Add the following to your `.bashrc` to display the current number of notes directly in your terminal prompt:

```bash
function taskr_prompt() {
    local count
    count=$(taskr n 2>/dev/null)

    # Bright ANSI colors with bold
    RED="\[\e[1;91m\]"
    GREEN="\[\e[1;92m\]"
    BLUE="\[\e[1;34m\]"
    RESET="\[\e[0m\]"

    PS1="${RED}(${count})${RESET} ${GREEN}\u@\h${RESET}:${BLUE}\w${RESET}\$ "
}

PROMPT_COMMAND=taskr_prompt
```

---

## üìÅ File Format

Your notes are stored in a CSV with the following headers:

```csv
Date,Note
2025-05-26T10:43:21Z,"Call mom"
```

## üì¶ Future Goals
